What is the output of the following snippet code?

public class Myclass
{
final static int x;

static {
x = 10;
}
public static void main(String[]
args) {
System.out.println(x);
}
}

The output will be 10. final static ensures that the same value stays the same. 
The value of x stays 10 and that is what is printed inside the main.
